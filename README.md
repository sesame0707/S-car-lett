## Background
This project reflects one of the dreams from my childhood — to construct a remote-controlled car myself. Back then, I was ten and did not know how to program. At my university, I acquired the knowledge about embedded systems and programming. Therefore, this dream could materialize. I have chosen this project as my engineer degree diploma thesis, and now it is visible to you!
